# COSC-214-Hospital-Management-System
Project repository for class

The goal of this project is to design and implement a Hospital Management System (HMS)
using essential data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, and
heaps. The system should manage various hospital functions such as patient records, doctor
schedules, and appointment queues. The system will allow hospital staff to manage patient
records, schedule appointments, organize doctor availability, and prioritize emergency cases.
The system must also support real-time data access and efficient updates. You must implement at least five key features for the system, each tied to the use of specific data structures.

Key Features:
Patient Record Management: Store and retrieve patient details such as name, age,
diagnosis, treatment history, etc.
Appointment Scheduling: Handle patient appointments based on doctor availability.
Doctor Management: Store and update doctor information such as specialization, avail-
able hours, and assigned patients.
Emergency Patient Prioritization: Handle emergency patients with higher priority than
regular Patients.
Search Functionality: Implement search functions to look up patients, doctors, or
appointments by various parameters.
